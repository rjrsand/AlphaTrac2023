                                    <p class="ps-3" style="text-decoration: underline;">20. Legal Proceedings and Enforcement</p>

                                    <p class="ps-3">Should legal proceedings be necessary to enforce these Terms and Conditions or address any violations, you agree to cover all related enforcement expenses, including attorney fees and court costs.</p>

                                    <p class="ps-3">Preliminary Discussions</p>

                                    <p class="ps-3">To streamline the resolution and minimize the costs associated with any dispute, claim, or controversy arising from these Terms and Conditions ("Dispute" individually, and "Disputes" collectively), both you and we agree to engage in a preliminary informal negotiation of any Dispute for at least thirty (30) days before initiating any arbitration. This negotiation period begins with a written notification from one party to the other.</p>

                                    <p class="ps-3">Mandatory Arbitration</p>

                                    <p class="ps-3">Should the parties fail to settle a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute will be settled exclusively and finally by binding arbitration. WITHOUT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, YOU WOULD POSSESS THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE IN COURT BEFORE A JURY. The arbitration process will be initiated and conducted according to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), and, as applicable, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both available on the AAA website at adr.org.</p>

                                    <p class="ps-3">The allocation of arbitration fees and the extent of your financial responsibility will be determined by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where relevant, will be limited by these rules. Arbitration may occur in person, via document submissions, by phone, or online. The arbitrator's decision will be issued in writing and will only include a detailed explanation if requested by one of the parties. The arbitrator is bound by applicable law, and their award can be contested if it does not comply with these laws. Unless required differently by AAA rules or applicable law, arbitration will occur in Summit County, Ohio. The parties retain the right to seek judicial intervention to compel arbitration, halt proceedings pending arbitration, or to validate, amend, overturn, or enforce the arbitrator's decision.</p>

                                    <p class="ps-3">Should arbitration not proceed, for any reason, and a Dispute is brought to court, such proceedings will be held in the state courts of Summit County, Ohio, or the federal courts of Summit County, Ohio. Both parties consent to and waive any objections to the jurisdiction and venue of these courts. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) is expressly excluded from these Terms and Conditions.</p>

                                    <p class="ps-3">In the event any part of this arbitration agreement is deemed unlawful or unenforceable, neither party will choose to arbitrate any Dispute lying within the portion of this agreement found invalid. Instead, such Dispute will be resolved in the competent courts mentioned above, to which both parties hereby agree to submit for jurisdiction.</p>

                                    <p class="ps-3">Limitations on Dispute Resolution</p>

                                    <p class="ps-3">The Parties concur that arbitration shall be confined solely to the dispute between them as individuals. In accordance with the fullest extent allowed by law, it is agreed that (a) arbitration will not be consolidated with any other proceedings; (b) no dispute shall be eligible for arbitration on a class-action basis or employ class action procedures; and (c) disputes cannot be brought on behalf of the general public or any other individuals in any representative capacity.</p>

                                    <p class="ps-3">Exclusions from Informal Negotiations and Arbitration</p>

                                    <p class="ps-3">It is mutually understood that certain disputes will not fall under the previously mentioned conditions for informal negotiations and arbitration, specifically: (a) disputes aiming to enforce or question the validity of any Party's intellectual property rights; (b) disputes stemming from claims of theft, piracy, privacy breaches, or unauthorized usage; (c) any claims seeking injunctive relief, and (d), suits by Company for payment of any amounts due under this Agreement. Should any part of this clause be deemed unlawful or not enforceable, then such disputes will not be subject to arbitration under the invalid or unenforceable part, and, will instead be resolved within the jurisdiction of the designated courts, to which the Parties consent to submit.</p>

                                    <p class="ps-3" style="text-decoration: underline;">21. Amendments and Corrections</p>

                                    <p class="ps-3">The Site may display content that includes typographical errors, inaccuracies, or missing information, such as product descriptions, pricing, availability, and other details.

                                    <p class="ps-3">Under no circumstance shall we, our directors, employees, or agents be liable to you or any third party for any direct, indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental, special, or punitive damages, including but not limited to lost profits, revenue loss, data loss, or other damages arising from your use of the Site.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages, so some of the above limitations and disclaimers may not apply to you, and you might have additional rights.</p>

                                    <p class="ps-3" style="text-decoration: underline;">24. Indemnification Clause</p>

                                    <p class="ps-3">By using our services, you consent to protect, indemnify, and absolve our company, its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, employees, agents, and partners from any claims, liabilities, costs, damages, or demands, including legal fees, brought by third parties as a result of: (1) your contributions to the site; (2) your utilization of the site; (3) any violation of these Terms and Conditions; (4) any failure on your part to uphold the representations and warranties outlined in these Terms and Conditions; (5) your infringement of third-party rights, notably intellectual property rights; or (6) any direct harm inflicted upon another site user with whom you interacted through the site.

You are also expected to cooperate with our defense efforts at your own expense. We commit to promptly inform you of any such legal proceedings that fall under this indemnification clause, once we are aware of them.</p>

                                    <p class="ps-3" style="text-decoration: underline;">25. Handling of User Data</p>

                                    <p class="ps-3" style="text-decoration: underline;">27. General Provisions</p>

                                    <p class="ps-3">These Terms and Conditions, together with any policies posted on the site, constitute the full agreement between you and us, superseding all prior discussions and agreements (whether oral, written, or electronic) concerning the site and its services. Our failure to assert any right or provision under these terms does not waive that right or provision. These terms are enforced to the maximum extent permitted by law. We reserve the right to transfer our rights and obligations under these terms to others at any time. We are not liable for any losses, delays, damages, or failures to act that are beyond our reasonable control. Should any part of these terms be deemed invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in effect. No joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship is established between you and us through these terms or your use of the site. The terms are to be interpreted without bias against the drafting party, and you waive any defenses arising from the electronic nature of these terms and the absence of physical signatures from both parties.
